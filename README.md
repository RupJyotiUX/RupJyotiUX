## 🧠 About Me

I'm a multidisciplinary designer focused on **UX/UI**, **graphic design**, **illustration**, and **videography**.  
My journey combines visual storytelling with **neuroscience-inspired design research**, aiming to create **inclusive and assistive experiences**, especially for individuals with disabilities.

Currently, I'm exploring the intersection of **neurotechnology** and **design** — turning brain signals and biofeedback into expressive, intuitive interfaces.
